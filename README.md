# The 10.000 most used words in Dutch
The words in this list come from the list hosted on [Liam Rosen's site](http://www.liamrosen.com/files/10000mostfrequentdutchwords.txt).

There are 3 lists:
1. The full list Liam Rosen hosted
1. The lowercased version of the list without duplicates (such as &ldquo;de&rdquo; and &ldquo;De&rdquo;) and witout single-letter &ldquo;words&rdquo;, except for &ldquo;u&rdquo; (which is the formal version of &ldquo;you&rdquo; in Dutch)
1. The previous list, without diatrics (such as &ldquo;&eacute;&rdquo;), and then those duplicates removed (such as &ldquo;geen&rdquo; and &ldquo;g&eacute;&eacute;n&rdquo;)
1. The last list with Diceware numbers in front

I personally use this to make a better Dutch [diceware passphrase](https://theworld.com/~reinhold/diceware.html), since the [original Dutch list](https://theworld.com/~reinhold/DicewareDutch.txt) contains amazing entries such as 
`3`, `qx`, and `@` and `@@`; making `@ qx 3 @@ c` a perfectly valid &ldquo;Dutch&rdquo; passphrase.

The first was put up here in case Liam Rosen's site should ever go down, the last three lists containing only sensible Dutch abbreviations and words are here for research and passphrasing purposes.
